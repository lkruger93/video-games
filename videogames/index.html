  <h1>Let's talk about girls in gaming</h1>
<div class="opening-par">
  <p>Despite an increasing number of women and girls being part of the gaming population, strong female characters are still hard to find!  It is our hope that raising awareness of the many types of strong female characters that exist in gaming will result in more female characters being introduced as something other than your stereotypical love interest or damsel. <br> 
  Luckily, there are a few games that feature some awesome female protagonists.  </p>

  <h2 class="lastofus-head">Ellie</h2>
  <div class="character-description">
    <p>Not many video game characters get more badass than Ellie from the series The Last of Us.  In the first game we see her as a young girl who gains confidence in her abilities and learns to be tough in a dystopian world where people will do anything to survive. <br> 
    The Last of Us Part II sees Ellie all grown up and out for revenge, who uses her abilities to track and kill whoever gets in her way.  Ellie is a great female character because she doesn't let anything stop her from  getting what she wants.</p>

  <h2 class="lastofus-head">Abby</h2>
  <div class="character-description">
    <img src="abby.png" alt="abby" class="character-pic">
    <p>Introduced in The Last of Us Part II, Abby is another character raised in a dystopian world who has learned to fight for herself.  Like Ellie, Abby looks for revenge and uses her brutal strength to get it.  Abby's background, much like Ellie's, contains grief and loss, a relatable feeling for so many of us.  She is portrayed as strong and capable of standing up to any other human opponent, gender or size being irrelevant.</p>

  <h2 class="horizon-head">ALOY</h2>
  <div class="character-description">
    <p>Aloy, the protagonist from the game Horizon: Zero Dawn, is the very definition of strong.  Not only does she never show fear, but she bravely takes on anything thrown at her, regardless of how big or dangerous it may be.  Although Aloy was raised as an outcast, she always knew how to speak to others to make them listen to and respect her.  Undeniably Aloy represents women in video games in a great way, as she never claims to be stronger or faster than anyone else but she is successful anyway thanks to her physical abilities as well as hardiness from a life in the wild.</p>

<div class="elena">

  <h2 class="lastofus-head">Elena</h2>
  <div class="character-description">
    <img src="elena.png" alt="elena">
    <p class="elena-description">The only non-playable character on this list, Elena Fisher is the spunky, smart and sometimes slightly foolish love interest of the series' protagonist, Nathan Drake.  Initially thought to be a mild-mannered reporter, Elena turned out to be anything but, as she constantly urged Nate to do things even he wasn't willing to do, resulting in danger but also large rewards.  Elena is maybe the most relatable character on this list, not living in a world with mythic beasts or where anyone is trying to kill her, but being strong in her own way, never giving up on her morals and doing what she believes is right.</p>

<div class="lara">
  <img src="tombraider.png" alt="tomb raider logo" class="laralogo">
  <h2 class="lastofus-head">Lara</h2>
  <div class="character-description">
    <p>As one of the first and most badass women in the history of gaming, Lara Croft has seen many crazy things throughout her life.  From battling dinosaurs with dual-wielding pistols to locking her butler in the freezer to solving centuries-old mysteries, Lara really has done it all.  Her skills are never doubted due to her being a girl, instead she's always been held in immense respect for everything she's proven she can do.</p>
